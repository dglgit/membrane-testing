# membrane-testing


This is a repository of molecular dynamics experiments involving simulating lipid membranes in different solvents. I wanted to see if ethanol would rip the membrane apart. 

Note that trajectory (.dcd) files are omitted because they are too big

Video of the simulation is linked below:

I used phosphatidylcholine as the membrane lipid.
